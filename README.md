# Queue

Queue is a linear data structure which follows FIFO(First In First Out) or LILO(Last In Last Out) pattern.

# Standard Operations
1. Enqueue() – Adds item to the queue from the rear.
2. Dequeue() – Removes item from the queue from the front.
3. isFull() – Checks if queue is full or not.
4. isEmpty() – Checks if queue empty or not.
5. count() – Gets number of items in the queue.

# Types
1. **Simple Queue** - It is a linear data structure which follows FIFO(First In First Out) or LILO(Last In Last Out) pattern.
2. **Circular Queue** - It  is an abstract data type which follows FIFO(First In First Out) pattern and  the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. 
3. **Priority Queue** - It is an abstract data type, which is similar to a queue, however, in the priority queue, every element has some priority. The priority of the elements in a priority queue determines the order in which elements are removed from the priority queue. Therefore all the elements are either arranged in an ascending or descending order.

# Applications
1. CPU scheduling, Disk Scheduling.
2. In real life, Call Center phone systems will use Queues, to hold people calling them in an order, until a service representative is free.
